PORTFOLIO   
//////////////////////////////////

Portfolio for me Geoff Millar. Yes me. Gg. 

had fun with this one, wanted to make it my own. Delved into more design into the css to really bring out more colors. I'm not one to use colors usually so wanted to push myself.
Also took awhile editing my profile picture. Wanted to make this if I were to show potential employers etc.... Hope you like.

CSS styles changed:
animations 
colors
background color
text
hover
